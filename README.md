## CityExplorer

### Overview

**City Explorer** is a Web application developed as part of a University project. The purpose of the project is to create the front-end of a web application which communicates with APIs such as OpenWeatherMap and Geoapify to display information about different
cities around the world. I decided to create this front-end with React as it is a more desirable skill to learn for industry
